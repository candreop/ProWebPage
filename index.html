           <A href="http://sbn.fnal.gov/" target="_top">
             Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Programme</A>.
           This is a leading experimental programme with the sensitivity to <b>perform a 
           definitive 5&sigma; test of the light-sterile
           neutrino hypothesis</b> associated with several long-standing experimental anomalies.
           Its superb sensitivity is enabled by the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology 
           and the use of 2 detectors at different baselines:
           SBND (112-t active mass) 110 m away from the neutrino beam target, and
           ICARUS (476-t) 600 m away.
           I serve as SBND Physics co-Coordinator, and as
           Systematics & Oscillation Sensitivity WG co-Coordinator for the overall SBN programme.
           I lead the development of a
           <b>simultaneous sterile neutrino oscillation and systematics 
           constraint fit</b> for SBN, as well as preparations for 
           SBND neutrino <b>cross-section measurements</b> of unprecedented precision.
           I also have a keen interest on Machine Learning, and my group prototypes
           novel Deep Learning methods for LArTPC neutrino event reconstruction.

           where, over the past decade,

           GENIE is the most commonly used neutrino interaction physics simulation:
           It provides a bridge between theory and measurement and
           it plays a crucial role throughout the lifecycle of every experiment.
           I also serve as the Systematics & Tuning WG Coordinator and

           Or main goal for the next 5 years is to build well-motivated 
           models of neutrino-nucleus interactions and perform a
           global <b>meta-analysis of all SBN measurements</b> of 
           neutrino interaction characteristics, in order to produce an <b>Argon tune</b>
