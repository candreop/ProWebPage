            Our PhD student
            <span class="NewsName">Francis Bench</span> has succesfully defended his
            PhD thesis titled <i>`Study of Neutrino and Anti-Neutrino Oscillations in the 3-Flavour PMNS 
            Paradigm at the T2K Experiment: Constraints on the Charge-Parity Invariance Violating Phase 
            and Search for Electron Anti-Neutrino Appearance'</i>.
            It is exceptionally hard to describe Francis's contributions within a few lines of a news item.
            This is a student who led the <A href="https://valor.pp.rl.ac.uk" target="_top">VALOR T2K 3-flavour fit</A>
            through several analysis and collaboration review rounds, wrote numerous technical notes, and had very direct

            Our PhD student
            <span class="NewsName">Rhiannon Jones</span> has succesfully defended her
            PhD thesis titled <i>`Muon-Neutrino Disappearance with Multiple Liquid Argon Time 
            Projecton Chambers in the Fermilab Booster Neutrino Beam'</i>.
            Rhiannon was a highly succesful and hard-working PhD student, 
            one of the first on SBND, who made ground-breaking contributions in 
            establishing the SBND simulation and reconstruction chains,
            developing exclusive SBND selections based on automated event reconstruction,
            leading the development (within the <A href="https://valor.pp.rl.ac.uk" target="_top">VALOR framework</A>)
            of the SBN oscillation analysis, and performing analyses of first mock data to
            explore limitations of the current SBN oscillation analysis paradigm.
            In addition to her numerous analysis tasks,
            over a year-long stay at Fermilab, Rhiannon supported the early SBND construction/installation work.
            We would like to thank Rhiannon's examiners, Dr. Ornella Palamara and Dr. Kostas Mavrokoridis.

            The new tunes improve the cross-section modelling of low-multiplicity inelastic channels (single-pion and double-pion production)

            <u><b>2020/12/01: Successful completion of our European Space Agency funded POSITRINO project </b></u>
            <br />
            On December 1st, <span class="NewsName">Costas Andreopoulos</span>, <span class="NewsName">Chris Barry</span>, 
            <span class="NewsName">Marco Roda</span> and <span class="NewsName">Júlia Tena Vidal</span> 
            participated in the <b>final review of the POSITRINO project</b>. This is a European Space Agency (ESA) funded project for a 
            preliminary exploration of the <b>innovative and disrupting technological concept of Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) 
            applications based on neutrinos</b>. 
            In this project, Liverpool teamed up with 
            Ana Cez&oacute;n Moro, Javier Fidalgo Prieto, Stefano Melis and others from 
            <A href="https://www.gmv.com" target="_top">GMV Innovations</A>, a technological 
            business group headquartered in Madrid, with leading presence in many sectors including Defence and Security, Space, and Aeronautics. 
            The project was aimed at applications where the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) cannot work, such as 
            i) submarine navigation, ii) navigation in the Earth poles, where no GNSS satellites are in view, or iii) sub-surface applications. 
            Submarine navigation was chosen as the benchmark application due to the obvious disrupting potential: 
            Using neutrinos for navigation, in conjunction with other sensors, would allow military nuclear submarines to remain submerged, 
            in stealth mode, for very long times. 
            The final review was attended by several key figures in the field of including the Head of ESA GNNS Strategy,
            as well as German, Italian and Czech state delegates to ESA. 
            According to Florin Grec overseeing this work on behalf of ESA along with Luis Mendes,
            <i>“The final outcome of the project surpassed our expectations and we are very pleased by the work done by GMV and Liverpool”.</i> 
            Details will appears in a future publication.

            geometry drivers) in order to run a host of alternative physics simulations
            that are development by smaller groups and lack the extensive toolkit present in GENIE.
            The proposal, exemplifies the key role of the GENIE group in supporting the development
            of physics simulations for the experimental neutrino community:            
            It would produce <b>significant effiencies in delivering alternative physics simulations into
            the full simulation chain of modern experiments</b>, removing the need for duplication of
            very extensive toolkits, and allowing developers to focus on the most crucial aspects of physics modelling.

            on the T2K hints for CP invariance violation by neutrinos! 
            Our group played a key role in this 3-flavour oscillation result through the development of the
            <A href="https://valor.pp.rl.ac.uk" target="_top">VALOR</A> analysis, 
            and our PhD student <span class="NewsName">Chris Barry</span> was a lead analyzer.
            This beautiful and world-leading result will be presented in detail in Chris' PhD dissertation!

            Our group played a crucial role in this effort, co-developed the simulation of the High-Pressure Gaseous Argon
            Time Projection Chamber (HPGArTPC) option for the DUNE Near Detector (ND), and provided the first end-to-end 3-flavour 
            oscillation analysis for DUNE for the evaluation of all ND design options.
