           I am centrally involved in preparations for the physics exploitation of the
           <A href="http://sbn.fnal.gov/" target="_top">
             Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) Programme</A>, 
           in particular in the 
           <A href="https://sbn-nd.fnal.gov" target="_top">
            SBN Near Detector (SBND)</A>.
           This is a leading experimental programme with the sensitivity to <b>perform a 
           definitive 5&sigma; test of the light-sterile
           neutrino hypothesis</b> associated with several long-standing experimental anomalies.
           Its superb sensitivity is enabled by the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology 
           and the use of 2 detectors at different baselines:
           SBND (112-t active mass) 110 m away from the neutrino beam target, and
           ICARUS (476-t) 600 m away.
           <br />
           I serve as 
           a member of the SBND Executive Committee (2020-present),
           SBND Physics co-Coordinator (2017-present), and as
           Systematics & Oscillation Sensitivity WG co-Coordinator (2018-present) for the overall SBN programme.
           I lead the development of a
           <b>simultaneous sterile neutrino oscillation and systematics 
           constraint fit</b> for SBN, as well as preparations for 
           SBND neutrino <b>cross-section measurements</b> of unprecedented precision.
           I also have a keen interest on Machine Learning, and my group prototypes
           novel Deep Learning methods for LArTPC neutrino event reconstruction.

           where, over the past decade,
           I performed electron (anti-)neutrino appearance searches and
           precision measurements of muon (anti-)neutrino disappearance, 
           and <b>produced the first direct evidence for neutrino CP violation.</b>

           and co-spokesperson of the international GENIE collaboration,
           providing a very well known <b>neutrino-nucleus event generator</b>,
           associated charged lepton-nucleus and hadron-nucleus event generators,

           GENIE performs crucial phemomenology research in the boundary between nuclear

           As such, it plays a crucial role throughout the lifecycle of every experiment.
           <br />            
           I also serve as the Systematics & Tuning WG Coordinator and
           my effort is focussed on further developments of the 
           <b>leading GENIE global analysis of neutrino scattering data</b> 
           and the production of <b> improved physics tunes</b>.
           A particular focal area is a global <b>meta-analysis of all SBN measurements</b> 
           of neutrino interaction characteristics, aiming to produce an <b>Argon tune</b> 
           for the early DUNE physics exploitation programme.
