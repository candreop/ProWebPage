            SBN Near Detector (SBND)</A>.
           This is a leading experimental programme with the sensitivity to <b>perform a 
           definitive 5&sigma; test of the light-sterile
           neutrino hypothesis</b> associated with several long-standing experimental anomalies.
           Its superb sensitivity is enabled by the Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) technology 
           and the use of 2 detectors at different baselines:
           SBND (112-t active mass) 110 m away from the neutrino beam target, and
           ICARUS (476-t) 600 m away.

           I serve as 
           a member of the SBND Executive Committee (2020-present),
           SBND Physics co-Coordinator (2017-present).
           In the past I served and as
           Systematics & Oscillation Sensitivity WG co-Coordinator (2018-2022) for the overall SBN program.
           Our group focuses on the development of the <b>SBN physics simulations</b>,
           teh development <b>simultaneous sterile neutrino oscillation and systematics

           I am a co-spokesperson of the international GENIE collaboration,

           GENIE performs crucial phemomenology research in the boundary between nuclear
           and particle physics, and it provides a bridge between theory and measurement.
           As such, it plays a crucial role throughout the lifecycle of every experiment.
           <br />            
           I also serve as the Systematics & Tuning WG Coordinator and
           my effort is focussed on further developments of the 
           <b>leading GENIE global analysis of neutrino scattering data</b> 
           and the production of <b> improved physics tunes</b>.
           A particular focal area is a global <b>meta-analysis of all SBN measurements</b> 
           of neutrino interaction characteristics, aiming to produce an <b>Argon tune</b> 
           for the early DUNE physics exploitation programme.
