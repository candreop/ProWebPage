            Our group played a crucial role in this effort, co-developed the simulation of the High-Pressure Gaseous Argon
            Time Projection Chamber (HPGArTPC) option for the DUNE Near Detector (ND), and provided the first end-to-end 3-flavour 
            oscillation analysis for DUNE for the evaluation of all ND design options.

            Congratulations to our PhD student <span class="NewsName">Rhiannon Jones</span> 
            and post-doctoral researcher <span class="NewsName">Steve Dennis</span> 
            who were awarded $1550 each by the Universities Research Association (URA) 
            to present their work on the GENIE global analysis of scattering data 
            and on the VALOR neutrino oscillation analysis,
            at <span class="NewsEvent">New Perspectives at Fermilab</span>.
            They were 2 only 11 early stage researchers who received funding by URA. 
            The URA is a consortium of 90 leading research-intensive universities in US, Canada, Japan, Italy and the UK.
